# hello-world
Hello,
My name is Antek and I am a 30-year-old man from Norway.
This is the first time I have ever created a GitHub branch message!
I am a Liverpool FC supporter and a gamer.
My favorite games include Gothic, Skyrim and Overwatch.
I hope I am on the right path to get into programming!
Regards!
